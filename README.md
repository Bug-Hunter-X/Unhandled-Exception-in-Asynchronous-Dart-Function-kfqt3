# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: improper exception handling within asynchronous operations.  The provided code attempts to fetch data from a remote API.  However, the exception handling is incomplete, leading to potential issues if the API request fails.

The `bug.dart` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.dart` offers a robust solution.

## Problem:

The `rethrow` statement in the `catch` block re-throws the exception. However, if this exception isn't caught higher in the call stack, it might not be logged or handled properly resulting in a silent failure or application crash.

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved approach by adding more specific exception handling and logging.  This ensures that all exceptions are properly caught, logged, and handled, providing better error reporting and application stability.
